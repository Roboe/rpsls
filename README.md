# RPSLS
RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock (RPSLS) Android app

# Why
It's cool. And it was a work for a class.

# When
Project was delivered on January 2014. This is the original source and it remains untouched.

# Where
Eclipse with ADT plugin. Android Studio was in alpha state.
Sorry, you need to import it to Android Studio/IDEA if you dislike Eclipse.

# WTF
There's a Easter Egg hidden (of course) inside the app, on main Activity (Menu.java). Check it out!
